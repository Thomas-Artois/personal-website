                <p class="intro-topics">A few words before we dive in. I have a much more outspoken background outside of tech than I have inside of it. So, below you'll find three topics that I've been interested in for the past few years. Then, towards the end of the page, you'll see what tech-related thing I've been playing around with.
                    <br><br>Or just click a button if you're not interested.

                    <p>First off, we have something that will undoubtedly be very boring to a lot of people.
                        <br>Given that I was a history teacher for 8 years, it goes without saying that (early) medieval history is very interesting to me. 
                        <br><br>Let me visit castles and churches on holiday, and I'm happy.

                    <p>After that, let's talk videogames. This is likely a clich√©, but nothing is as calming as when you can deepdive into a videogame and don't have to think about much else.
                        <br><br>The genre doesn't matter much, although I have a few preferences. Bonus points if you can guess which game this image is from.

                    <p>Lastly, I have always enjoyed to travel. The picture on the right shows a destination that was extremely fun to travel to: Japan. This was one sight during a pilgrimage hike. You were able to choose how long you walked on the route, going from 2 days to 2 to 3 weeks.
                        <br><br>Other awesome destinations for these past 10 years were Tibet, Ecuador or Armenia. This past year, with the birth of our son, we sought destinations closer to home... but we can't wait to travel out into the world again.

                <p>To close it all off, below you can see a tech-related topic which I've been curious about ever since it hit the news.</p>

                    <p> That is, AI-generated images. It's insane to me how AI can generate images off prompts, and I've been having much fun with creating some funny or weird pictures. Honestly, this is a world that's intriguing and in no way directly related to this field I'm setting foot in, but still it's interesting!</p>
